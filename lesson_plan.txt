Twitter Bootstrap Lab - 1 hour

Objective: Students will be able to add styling to
a Rails app using Twitter Bootstrap using the
Twitter Bootstrap Gem.

Why: Using Twitter Bootstrap allows you to focus
more on getting the logic portion of a project down
as many of the features you would need for the
design and layout is built in. As an added bonus
your app will be very flexible and look good on
different browsers as well as most mobile devices!

10 mins lecture: Bootstrap was originally created
by a bunch of engineers within Twitter to as a way
to solve problems that they were encountering often
with one simple body of CSS code. It's a great way
to get your app up and styled quickly, which is
especially great if you are prototyping (or if you
are not a huge fan of CSS).

How to use if you don't want lots of customization: 
1. in your gem file put 'gem "twitter-bootstrap-rails"'
2. run bundler with 'bundle install'
3. run generator with 'rails generate bootstrap:install static'
4. add tags that are specific to Twitter bootstrap into your <div> tags in your .erb files. 
For example, to make a nav bar:

<div class="navbar">
  <div class="navbar-inner">
    <div class="container">
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

If you want more customization, you can add the less gem.
